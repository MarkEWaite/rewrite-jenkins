description: |
  Migrate rewrite recipe and test from version 7 to version 8.
  While most parts can be automatically migrated, there are some complex and open-ended scenarios that require manual attention.
  In those cases, this recipe will add a comment to the code and request a human to review and handle it manually.
  Reference : Migration guide (URL to be written).
